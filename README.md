### Terminology

#### What is HTML?

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It’s the standard markup language — or set of rules and
symbols — for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. You are (probably) currently
viewing this README on a web page, which is built with HTML.

To view the HTML, you can go into most browsers, right click on the web page, and click inspect.
Then you’ll see the HTML displayed in dev tools.

#### What is a tag in HTML?

A tag in HTML describes the content that lives inside it to a browser. A tag name is written inside
angled brackets `< >`. There are many different tags that exist in HTML to describe the content of
the page. For example, a `<p>` tag describes a paragraph, a `<section>` tag describes a section, an
`<li>` tag describes a list item, a `<label>` describes a form input label, and so on.

```html
<section>
  <p>
    Here's an example of a sentence inside a paragraph tag. This paragraph lives inside a section on
    the page.
  </p>
</section>
```

Most tags in HTML require an opening and closing tag to be valid, with some exceptions such as the
`<img />` tag and `<input />` tag. Tags that do not require a closing tag are referred to as
'self-closing' tags.

- An opening paragraph tag: `<p>`
- A closing paragraph tag: `</p>`

Most tags in HTML have default CSS properties which affect how the content inside the tag is
presented on the page.

#### What is an attribute in HTML?

Attributes allow you to customise tags. Where tags require opening and closing tags, attributes are
declared on the opening tag. For example:

```html
<td colspan="4">This is a table cell</td>
```

The first attribute you will use in your HTML document is to declare the language attribute on the
`<html>` tag, like so:

```html
<html lang="en">
  <!-- the rest of your HTML document -->
</html>
```

Attributes on self-closing tags are declared in the same way.

```html
<img src="image.png" alt="This is the alternative text attribute value" />
```
